# Disclaimer

Maybe if you copy and paste my codes on the link of its respectives problems won't work becaseu there's a little difference, on the hackerrank site it is necessary to return a value, in my code i print them, when necessary i change to finish the challenge.

It is recommended to you think by yourself to improve your logical thinking, do not copy and paste!
